These notes summarize the lecture notes from the Linear Modelling course at Sheffield's School of Mathematics and Statistics, MSc degree programme. The original notes were written by Dr.\ Jeremy Oakley. This summary is completely derived from these notes and from other MSc sources. Any errors are most probably mine.

Everything is in matrix form unless a lower case letter with a subscript (such as $x_i$) is used (even there, I might deviate from this convention if I need to index sub-matrices; it's best to look at the context to decide what is meant).
